# Module3-Samples

This repository contains sample code/apps for Module 3.

* SoMuchControl: a sample of some UI controls, which we will extend to explore
toasts, snackbars and dialog boxes.
* TaskParcels: in which we will explore how to pass Parcels instead of Bundles
and explore some basic form design.
