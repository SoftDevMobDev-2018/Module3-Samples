# Module3-Samples

This repository contains sample code/apps for Module 3.

* SoMuchControl: a sample of some UI controls, which we will extend to explore
toasts, snackbars and dialog boxes.
* TaskParcels: in which we will explore how to pass Parcels instead of Bundles
and explore some basic form design.
* HistoryAppList: in this app we use a longer list of sites around Hawthorn to
demonstrate how lists work. The images are from the State Library of Victoria
(http://www.slv.vic.gov.au).
* Bits: using binary/hex conversion to show how fragments work.
